# GBF Experience Calculator
 **A simple calculator for calculating how much fodder you need.**
 **Now with spark counter and rank calculations!**

### Usage
- Input the current level of your weapon/summon/character and your target level to see the total exp needed.
- The calculator will display the needed Angel Items **OR** Archangel Items to reach the target level.
- Note that the calculator will always give the base weapons needed (i.e. Total exp is 1001: given that bonus exp is 0%, Archangel Weapons will display 3.)
